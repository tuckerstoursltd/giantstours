## Hey! Thomas is my name and Belfast Is a City For All


I am a highly experienced and qualified tour guide based in Belfast, known for providing the best tours in the North of Ireland. As a fully qualified tour guide for the UK and Ireland with my OCN NI Level 2 & 3 Certificate in Tour Guiding, and fully insured, you can trust that your tour experience will be both safe and enjoyable.

I am passionate about showing visitors the hidden gems of my beloved hometown, from the towering Belfast hills that offer stunning views of the city, to the historic shipyards of the Titanic Quarter. Join me on a private tour in my luxury 8 seater WiFi enabled Mercedes Vito with leather interior a and discover the world-renowned street art on the famous Falls Road, where you can even see **Painted Murals of Myself**, as well as other great examples of Belfast's famous street art. We can also visit Peace Walls, Shankill Road, and admire the beautiful architecture of Belfast City Centre.

For an unforgettable adventure, why not book a private tour along the scenic Causeway Coastal Route? This drive is considered one of the world's most spectacular, and along the way, we can visit picturesque locations such as Giant's Causeway, Bushmill's Distillery, Ballycastle, and Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge.

Fans of Game of Thrones will love my ultimate Game of Thrones tour, where we will visit the famous filming locations from the blockbuster series. And for the ultimate adrenaline rush, I highly recommend a trip to Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, followed by a visit to the iconic Dark Hedges.

Throughout your tour, you can sit back, relax, and enjoy complimentary Wi-Fi on board as we drive you back to your drop-off point in Belfast. With me as your guide, you are guaranteed an awesome tour!
